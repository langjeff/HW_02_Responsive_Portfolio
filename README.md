## Project title
This is my portfolio site.

## Motivation
I am now about 1/3 of the way through my coding bootcamp and we needed to update our portfolio page and feature some of our Github projects, update our LinkedIn and provide a link to our current resume.

 
## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used


## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.

## Credits
Give proper credits. This could be a link to any repo which inspired you to build this project, any blogposts or links to people who contrbuted in this project.

## Project Purpose

```
# Unit 08 Project 1 Homework: Professional Materials
​
Now that you've had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive.
​
If you are opting out of career services, this is _still a required assignment_. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is _necessary_ if you're applying for jobs, but it's also _critical_ on your journey as a developer.
​
## Requirements
​
* Submit an updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.
​
* Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.
​
* Submit an updated resume
​
* Submit an updated LinkedIn profile
​
## Grading
​
| Requirement      | Weight |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Portoflio        | 40%    |
| GitHub Profile   | 40%    |
| Resume           | 10%    |
| LinkedIn Profile | 10%    |

## Instructions
​
1. [Updated Portfolio](#updated-portfolio)
2. [GitHub Profile](#updated-github-profile)
3. [Updated Resume](#updated-resume)
4. [Updated LinkedIn](#updated-linkedin)
​
## Updated Portfolio
​
💁 Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [Career Services milestone resources for online presence](https://sites.google.com/2u.com/careerservices-webdev/coding-milestones/milestone-polish-online-presence).
​
Your updated portfolio should:
​
1. Display your full name, email, and phone number
​
2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile
​
3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume
​
4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:
​
    * Project title
​
    * Link to the deployed version
​
    * Link to the GitHub repository
​
    * Screenshot of the deployed application
​
5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.
​
### Design
​
Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:
​
* Mobile-first design
​
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
​
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
​
## Updated GitHub Profile
​
Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. 
​
Your GitHub profile must contain at least the following items:
​
1. Professional profile picture
​
   * A photo or an image other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)
​
2. Biography
​
3. Your current location
​
4. Email address
​
5. Link to your deployed portfolio
​
6. At least 2 pinned repositories:
​
   * Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.
​
   * Click "Customize your pins"
​
   * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share
​
7. Follow a few of your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.
​
8. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:
​
   * Title of app
   * Live link to deployed app
   * List of technologies used
   * 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is
   * 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app
   * License (usually MIT)
   * Contact information for you and any collaborators
​
9. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.
​
